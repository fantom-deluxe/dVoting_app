# dVoting_app
*(Submitted for Mini Project in partial fulfilment of the B.Tech. Degree  in Information Technology under the Indian Institute of Engineering  Science and Technology)* <br>
<br>
Developed a secure and tamper-proof online voting dApp using Ethereum blockchain with Solidity, Ganache, and Truffle Suite. Implemented Proof of Work to ensure data integrity and mitigate common cyber threats such as double voting and data tampering.

**Key Highlights:**
- Designed smart contracts for voter registration and vote casting.
- Simulated attacks like double voting and analyzed system resistance.
- Deployed and tested contracts on a local Ethereum network using Ganache.
- Ensured immutability and transparency through blockchain validation.
- Technologies Used: Solidity, Ganache, Truffle, Ethereum, MetaMask, JavaScript.
<br>

**Contribution:** <br>
Contributed to the development of a decentralized voting (dVoting) application by assisting in designing the overall project architecture. Analyzed and understood Solidity smart contracts to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities, enhancing the applicationâ€™s resistance to attacks such as double voting and unauthorized access.
